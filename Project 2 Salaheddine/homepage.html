            <h2>Brief History of Video Games</h2>
            <p>
                A video game is a game played by electronically manipulating images generated by a computer program on a monitor.
                The earliest known video game was <strong>Tennis for Two</strong>, created by physicist William Higinbotham in 1958.
                It was a simple simulation similar to Ping Pong, designed to entertain visitors at a laboratory open house.

                The 1970s marked the commercial debut of video games, with arcade classics like <strong>Pong</strong> paving the way for
                broader interest. Home gaming gained popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s with consoles like the
                <strong>Atari 2600</strong>. Although the industry faced a major crash in 1983, it rebounded with the release
                of Nintendo's NES in 1985, leading to the development of iconic franchises such as <strong>Super Mario</strong>
                and <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>.

                The 1990s brought significant advancements in 3D graphics and gameplay, while the 2000s saw gaming become
                mainstream, thanks to online multiplayer and immersive storytelling. Today, the industry continues to evolve
                with mobile gaming, virtual reality, and esports, solidifying video games as a dominant form of entertainment.
